      "\n",
      "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is revolutionizing how LLMs access tools, but implementation has been complex... until now. 😉 \n",

      "With our latest release, any Gradio app BECOMES an MCP server with ONE simple parameter:\n",

      "(mcp_server=True)\n",
      "\n",
      "This means your custom Python functions—from image generators to specialized calculators—can be instantly available to Claude, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "📈 What this enables:\n",
      "- Enhance LLMs with domain-specific capabilities or tools\n",
      "- 🤯👉DEPLOY YOUR MCP SERVERS FOR FREE ON Hugging Face Spaces👈🤯\n",
      "- Automatic file handling and data conversion for your MCP Server (this is 🔥) \n",

      "Hugging Face\n",
      ", smolagents, is the tinyest ever. It implements fewer features than other frameworks -> that's the feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "➡️ The main issue among agentic frameworks is complexity : they tend to pile up abstractions, trying to solve everything rather than bein part of a bigger workflow. So instead of making the all-encompassing factory, we set out to make the smallest possible framework for agents, the one that would just provide the essential building blocks and let users build the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "💡 Optimizing for reducing size is interesting, because it forces you to consider simplicity at each step :\n",
      "- do we need this abstraction, won't it make the code less readable?\n",
      "- instead of adding this feature, why shouldn't we just provide the building blocks that will let users build it for themselves?\n",
